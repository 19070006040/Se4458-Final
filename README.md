## Hotel Booking System

### Introduction:
The hotel booking system is a web application designed to facilitate hotel reservation management. The users can search hotels by destination point, dates and number of people and they can book a hotel.

### Design:
The OtelRezervasyonAPI project employs a layered architecture to enhance modularity and maintainability. Its components include the Presentation Layer, where API controllers handle HTTP requests and responses, 
facilitating operations such as managing customers, rooms, hotels, and reservations. The Business Logic Layer encapsulates core application logic, often implemented through services. Meanwhile, the Data Access Layer 
utilizes Entity Framework Core to interact with the SQL Server database, defining data models like Customer, Room, Hotel, and Reservation. Migrations manage database schema changes seamlessly. Configurations and 
middleware in Program.cs ensure smooth functioning, including HTTPS redirection, authorization, and Swagger integration for API documentation and testing. This architecture ensures scalability and separation of concerns, 
making the project robust and easily maintainable.

### Issues:
The main issue was that I had limited time for this project due to the finals and projects of my other courses.
Notification System requirements gave me the hard time.
I generally had some troubles while trying to complete most important parts for the project. It is not fully meets the requirements and i apologize for that.
